# Jenkins Project with Docker

This project provides a setup for running Jenkins in a Docker container. It includes a custom Jenkins environment, an Nginx reverse proxy, and a Docker Compose configuration for easy orchestration.

## Installation

1.  **Install Docker and Docker Compose.** Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the repository.** Clone this repository to your local machine.
3.  **Run Docker Compose.** Run the following command to build and start the containers:
